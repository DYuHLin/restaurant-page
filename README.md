# restaurant-page
I learnt a lot more about webpack and how it is used while doing this project. I learnt how to create
webpages in different js files while webpack imported them in a main.js file in a completely different folder. I also learnt how to create tabs which I, for some reason struggled with. I also learnt a little something about animations and transitions in css which was cool.
